# Custom Object Detection using Tensorflow

## Overview
This repository contains code and instructions to train a custom object detection model using TensorFlow. The goal of this project is to detect specific objects in images by training a model on custom data. We leverage TensorFlowâ€™s object detection API, which offers a wide range of pre-trained models that can be fine-tuned for our use case.
